Just run <tt>gem install defaults</tt>

== Usage

Add the method call +defaults+ to your model.

  class Page < ActiveRecord::Base
    defaults :title => "New page", :body => "Put your text here"
  end

Attributes will be set only if it's a new record and the attribute is blank.

Retrieve the default attribute with the +default_for+ instance method:

  @page.default_for(:title)

You can pass Proc as attribute:

You can override the default attributes as follow:

  Page.default_options = {:title => "Here's your new page", :body => "Write your page text"}
